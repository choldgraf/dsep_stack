<h1 id="The-DataHub-Deployment-Process">The DataHub Deployment Process<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-DataHub-Deployment-Process"> </a></h1><p>The DataHub is a JupyterHub that provides the environment in which all
Data 8 students will work. JupyterHub has made great improvements to
scalability and reliability in recent years, and has adopted modern-day
cloud deployment technology such as Kubernetes.</p>
<p>This page details the process that the Data 8 tech team uses in order to
maintain and upgrade the DataHub.</p>
<h2 id="The-DataHub-deployment-repository">The DataHub deployment repository<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-DataHub-deployment-repository"> </a></h2><p>The current deployment configuration for the DataHub is hosted as a
<a href="https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub">GitHub repository</a>. Any
changes made to this repository should immediately be reflected in the
live DataHub.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two branches</strong> for the DataHub repository - one for <code>staging</code>, and
another for <code>prod</code> (short for "production"). Each branch controls a
different JupyterHub deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>staging</code> lives at <a href="staging.datahub.berkeley.edu">staging.datahub.berkeley.edu</a>.
It is used by the Data 8 development team to test modifications before they're
deployed to the production environment. Students do not use this JupyterHub.</li>
<li><code>prod</code> lives at <a href="datahub.berkeley.edu">datahub.berkeley.edu</a>. It is the
JupyterHub that students use, and as such has  higher standards for stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DataHub uses <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> (short for
"continuous integration") to automatically run tests and code every
time a change is made to the DataHub master repository. This is
also used to automatically deploy these changes to the <code>staging</code>
and <code>prod</code> DataHub deployments when new changes are made.</p>
<h2 id="Modifying-the-DataHub-deployment">Modifying the DataHub deployment<a class="anchor-link" href="#Modifying-the-DataHub-deployment"> </a></h2><p>The following steps are followed by the Data 8 tech team any time
a modification must be made to the DataHub.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub">DataHub repository</a>, always work from this fork.</li>
<li>Pull the latest changes from the DataHub repository into your fork.</li>
<li>Create a new branch for your changes.</li>
<li>Make the modifications necessary to this branch (this is
usually something like modifying the <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/blob/staging/datahub/config.yaml">DataHub helm chart</a> or editing the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/berkeleydsep/">DataHub Docker Image</a>).</li>
<li>Commit your changes and create a pull request. The pull request
should be against <strong><code>staging</code></strong>, not against <code>prod</code>.</li>
<li>The pull request will trigger a Travis CI process, and
potentially a rebuild of docker images depending on what
modifications have been proposed.</li>
<li>Once the CI process is complete and if there are no problems, the committer requests that someone review the PR before merging.</li>
<li>If all looks well, merge the PR into <code>staging</code>. This will trigger
another Travis step which automatically upgrades the
DataHub deployment at <code>staging.datahub.berkeley.edu</code>.</li>
<li>After this upgrade finishes (per the logs in Travis CI), the team
tests the changes by performing actions on
<code>staging.datahub.berkeley.edu</code> (e.g., trying to import
  a package that was added)</li>
<li>If <code>staging</code> tests fail, or if there are any problems during the
live user testing, <strong>never update <code>prod</code></strong>. Revert the change via
the GitHub UI and debug before submitting another PR to <code>staging</code>.</li>
<li>If the change passes tests and looks successful on <code>staging</code>, create
a <strong>new PR</strong> to merge <code>staging</code> into <code>prod</code>. This will trigger
a similar Travis process to deploy to <code>prod</code> at
<a href="datahub.berkeley.edu">datahub.berkeley.edu</a>.
Test your change on production for good measure.</li>
<li>Celebrate!</li>
</ul>

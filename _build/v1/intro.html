<h1 id="An-Educator's-Guide-to-Data-8">An Educator's Guide to Data 8<a class="anchor-link" href="#An-Educator's-Guide-to-Data-8"> </a></h1><p>Data 8 is a "Foundations in Data Science" course taught for first year students at
UC Berkeley. It combines principles/skills in statistics, programming, inference, modeling,
hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration. It provides a foundation in
the many fields encompassed by "data science", and gives students a practical introduction
to the field.</p>
<p>This online resource serves as a "snapshot" of the Data 8 stack, and a guide for others
that wish to imitate the Data 8 model. It includes discussion of the
pedagogical approach, concepts / topics covered, and technical pieces used in
the class.</p>
<p>All of the tools that Data 8 uses are <strong>open source</strong>, and available for the community to
use (either as broader community-run projects, or as Berkeley projects). The Data 8 textbook
is free to use at [<a href="https://inferentialthinking.com">https://inferentialthinking.com</a>]. If you'd like to modify the textbook's
content for your own course, please shoot us an email!</p>
<h2 id="This-book's-structure">This book's structure<a class="anchor-link" href="#This-book's-structure"> </a></h2><p>See the chapters to the left to navigate this book. Below is a general structure
of the material.</p>
<h3 id="Deploying-your-own-Data-8-course-from-scratch">Deploying your own Data 8 course from scratch<a class="anchor-link" href="#Deploying-your-own-Data-8-course-from-scratch"> </a></h3><p>The first section of this guide is a step-by-step guide to deploy your
own version of Data 8. It explains how to create a JupyterHub running in the cloud that students
can access, how to connect this JupyterHub with the coding environment that Data 8 students use,
and how to incorporate course materials into your class. Check it out here:</p>

<h3 id="Technical-and-pedagogical-decisions-for-Data-8">Technical and pedagogical decisions for Data 8<a class="anchor-link" href="#Technical-and-pedagogical-decisions-for-Data-8"> </a></h3><p>These sections are an overview of
the technical and pedagogical pieces that make up Data 8. They are a high-level reference
for running your own Data 8 course, or for taking a similar technical approach to teaching data science.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="teaching/README">Teaching and Pedagogy</a> covers the unique blend of computational, coding, and conceptual information taught in Data 8.</li>
<li><a href="tech/README">The Data 8 Tech Stack</a> describes the technical pieces of Data 8, including hosting
student environments, grading, and managing the course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Other-Data-8-information">Other Data 8 information<a class="anchor-link" href="#Other-Data-8-information"> </a></h3><p>All Data 8 materials are freely available online. The course material in full can be accessed
at the following online resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.data8.org">The Data 8 Course Site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.inferentialthinking.com/">The Data 8 Course Textbook</a></li>

<h2 id="Other-resources">Other resources<a class="anchor-link" href="#Other-resources"> </a></h2><p>There are many other resources out there for using open technology to facilitate
data analytics pedagogy. Here are a few notable resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/">The UC Berkeley JupyterHubs guide</a> contains
information about all of the JupyterHubs at UC Berkeley, and is a good reference for how
our teams coordinate technical infrastructure across classes and resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/">The Jupyter for Education Handbook</a>
is a more general resource for teaching using tools in the Jupyter ecosystem, and has several
best-practices and tips.</li>

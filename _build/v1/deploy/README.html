<h1 id="Deploy-Data-8-for-your-course">Deploy Data 8 for your course<a class="anchor-link" href="#Deploy-Data-8-for-your-course"> </a></h1><p>This section covers how to set up Data 8 from scratch. It gives a broad overview
of technical pieces at play, but is to-the-point in terms of setting
things up. For information about the motivations and decisions surrounding the
Data 8 class, see the other components of this guide.</p>
<h2 id="Tools-you'll-use">Tools you'll use<a class="anchor-link" href="#Tools-you'll-use"> </a></h2><p>Setting up your own Data 8 course repository will require using a few pieces
of technology and skills. Here's a short list of each, and what they'll be
used for.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org">JupyterHub</a> is the software that manage user
accounts and creates interactive sessions for users.</li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> are used to
host the textbook for the course, and control revisions of all course
materials. It's also where you can host your course template online.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> (optional, only if your course is
around 60 students) is used to orchestrate the cloud
resources that serve user sessions.</li>
</ul>

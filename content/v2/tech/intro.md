# The Educator's Guide to Technology Infrastructure for Data 8

Creating a data science course from first-principles requires considerable
advances in the technology available to instructors. In creating Data 8, the
development team has worked closely with members of the open-source community,
and has contributed to or spun off many open source projects. The goal driving
development of technology for Data 8 is to *develop an open platform of which
Berkeley happens to be the first user.*

As such, most of these components are freely available to the educational community, and we welcome
others to adopt these tools for their own uses and become contributors to
these projects over time.

The following is an outline of the technical pieces that go into running Data 8.
It is broken down by activity / need so that it might be most useful for others
hoping to accomplish the same goals.

# Connector courses


Connectors are two-unit (usually) courses which give students an in-depth introduction into the use of the data science toolkit and concepts in a particular field. Connector courses vary every semester, but are usually within the domain of social sciences. Connectors are not an official part of Data 8, though they play a crucial role in the data science education ecosystem with the DSEP (Data Science Education Program). Students are encouraged to take them together with Data 8 or a semester after they take Data 8.

# Modules 

Modules are short explorations into data science that can be implemented into (almost) any class on campus. Modules allow students to explore a data set relevant to their course with the help of the data science toolkit. 

Like connectors, modules vary widely, and can be customized to fit each instructor's need and objective for the course. A module might include one or two lectures on analyzing course-relevant data and learning how to interpret the graphs, or they can be a set of labs in which students will learn the basics of programming and statistics which they can apply to their field of studies; some modules can also include a final class project ran in Jupyter Notebooks.

Modules allow students from different fields of studies to get familiarized with the foundations of data analysis.

You can learn more about the modules the DSEP Team has created over the years on the [Modules webpage](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/modules)

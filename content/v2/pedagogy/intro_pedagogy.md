# The Data 8 Pedagogy Guide

Data 8 is a “The Foundations of Data Science” course taught to first-year students at UC Berkeley. It combines principles and skills from statistics and computer science, such as inference, modeling, hypothesis testing, visualization, and others. It provides a foundation in the many disciplines encompassed by “data science”, and gives students a practical introduction to the field. 

Teaching Data Science requires a shift in the way we traditionally teach each of the individual concepts. What were once introductory classes in statistics, computer science, and ethics (among others) are now combined into a single introductory course. 


This book covers many of the pedagogical decisions that were made in Data 8 and should be seen as a reference and background for it.

All of the tools that Data 8 uses are open source, and available for the community to use (either as broader community-run projects, or as Berkeley projects). The course material can be accessed at the following online resources:

- [The Data 8 Course Site](http://data8.org)
- [The Data 8 Course Textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro)
